# # Variational Bayesian GAN for Mixtures-of-Gaussian
To test the ability to infer a multi-modal posterior which helps avoiding
the mode collapse, an instance of over-tting in regular GAN training. We generate 2-
dimensional synthetic data by mixtures of 8 Gaussian distribution scattered equality
on circumference. We run the synthetic data on our proposed, vanilla GAN and
Bayesian GAN, showing 100 samples from the models every 10000 iterations and
nd out that our proposed and Bayesian GAN are more powerful to capture the
modes of mixtures of Gaussian avoiding the mode collapse.
